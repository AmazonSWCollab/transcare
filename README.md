Transgender individuals face inequities and challenges in regards to healthcare access. This is not fair, and we aim to help by providing an app where transgender people can find all the information that they need to access, request, and receive life-saving healthcare. Stay tuned for the soon to come `v0.0.1` release and future updates and upgrades!
