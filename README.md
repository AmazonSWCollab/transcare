Transgender individuals face inequities and challenges in regards to healthcare access. This is not fair, and we aim to help by providing an app where transgender people can find all the information they need to access healthcare and successfully request and receive life-saving healthcare. Stay tuned for the prototype and future updates and upgrades!
