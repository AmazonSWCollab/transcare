# TranscendCare API

> Backend of TranscendCare

# Tech Stacks:
- Typescript
- Fastify 
- Drizzle-ORM
- PostgreSQL (Railway)
- Go
- Fiber
- Colly
- sqlc

# Setup:

- At the moment the Backend is split into both a Typescript and Go service. Instructions for setting up each are included in their respecitve directories. However the system requirements for running both are:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
3. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

**Ideally you should be using a Linux based OS, however you are more than welcome to try this on your own exotic system**
